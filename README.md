## <a name="syllabus"></a>Syllabus

This is a half-semester senior seminar focused on the critical evaluation of behavior genetics research. The aim of this course is to provide students with a deeper understanding of the contribution that genes make to individual differences in behavior, while carefully considering the ethical implications and historical context of this field.

**Prerequisites**: Senior standing, Psychology major

In this seminar you will:

- Critically evaluate primary research articles in behavior genetics,
- Understand how major research designs address different questions and hypotheses,
- Formulate research problems and determine the degree to which explanations are supported by empirical evidence,
- Recognize the relevance of behavior genetics to everyday life and its ethical implications,
- Communicate scientific findings effectively to diverse audiences.

This seminar involves intensive reading, discussion, and critical analysis of primary research articles related to behavior genetics. You will engage with cutting-edge research while considering the field's complex history and ethical dimensions.

### Ethics Statement

The history of behavior genetics is inextricably linked with eugenics and racism. 

We will discuss the historical and current ways in which behavior genetics has been used to support white supremacy, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and ableism. 

The use of behavior genetics research and principles to support racism and other forms of discrimination is based on (often willful) misinterpretation of the underlying statistical models on which the science relies. 

There are reasonable questions to be asked about whether it is possible to conduct behavior genetics research without doing harm to marginalized people. 

One goal of this course is to understand the forms of knowledge production that are used within behavior genetics, interrogate the limits of that knowledge, and consider how behavior genetics has been/is/will be used (and misused) to impact the lives of real people.

### A Note on Pedagogy

This course is designed as a senior-level seminar emphasizing critical engagement with primary research literature. The format differs from the typical human behavior genetics course - the focus is less on preparing STEM-focused students to be academic or industry researchers and more on preparing advanced undergraduates to be informed consumers, caregivers, and citizens in a world where genetics is increasingly marketed as a way to make critically important decisions.

Unlike a traditional lecture course, this seminar requires active participation in discussions, critical analysis of research articles, and the creation of evidence-based scientific communication. The skills developed here - accessing, reading, evaluating, and synthesizing primary research literature - are essential for lifelong learning in a constantly developing field.

Every instructor necessarily makes decisions about what content to include and how to present it. There is no such thing as a neutral presentation of any topic, much less one that has such profound personal and societal implications. For this reason, the material is presented from my first-person perspective, as both an expert in the field and as a whole human being.

If you are looking for material that takes a more standard approach to an introduction to human behavior genetics, I recommend Scott Stoltenberg's [Foundations of Behavior Genetics](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/foundations-of-behavior-genetics/D56A9C68E53ED87EAD1E5529A88CC3D0#overview) textbook and/or Matt McGue's [Introduction to Behavioral Genetics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/behavioralgenetics) course on Coursera. 

### Course Structure

This is a 1-credit half-semester seminar that meets twice weekly. As a senior-level seminar, plan to spend approximately 3 hours per week on this course (1 hour of class meetings + 2 hours of reading and preparation).

**Grades** are based on the total number of points earned by the end of the half-semester. There are potentially 300 points to be earned.

| Points | Letter Grade |
| --- | ----------- |
| 270 + | A |
| 240 - 269 | B |
| 210 - 239 | C |
| 180 - 209 | D |
| < 180 | F |

There are no +s or -s, only letter grades.

Points are earned in four ways:

**[Reaction Essays](materials/assignment_reaction_essay.md) (50 points)**: You will write a Reaction Essay for 5 weeks during the semester (10 points each). Submit a two-page paper in reaction to the readings scheduled for that week. Essays may be single-spaced (approx. 1,000 words) or double-spaced (approx. 500 words) but not to exceed two pages. 

A Reaction Essay is not a simple summary or re-wording of the article abstracts. It is intended to serve as an intellectual exercise that may take the form of an agreement, disagreement, elaboration, contrast, parallel, or critical analysis of the work. The Reaction Essays prepare you for class discussion by helping you think critically about the readings before class.

Examples of sentences to get you started:
- "I see a contradiction between [Author's] article and the section we read about…"
- "A possible experiment that could be conducted to test the hypothesis described in [Author's] article involves…"
- "The theory described in [Author's] article could be used to improve understanding of…"
- "The theory in [Author's] article helped me to analyze an experience that I once had…"
- "I disagree with the interpretation of the findings described in [Author's] article because…"

Reaction Essays are due before class on the day the readings will be discussed.

**[Class Discussion and Participation](materials/guide_class_participation.md) (100 points)**: The learning experience in this seminar involves active sharing of thoughts during class discussions focused on the required readings. Come to class willing and prepared to voice your thoughts and opinions; ask questions during class. As you review assigned readings and write your Reaction Essays, consider: What is the main research question? What conclusion does the article provide? What evidence supports this conclusion? Is this evidence sound? What questions do you still have? Are there weaknesses in the methodology, statistics, or conclusions?

**[Video/Audio Analysis](materials/assignment_video_audio_analysis.md) (50 points)**: For this assignment, you will watch a TED Talk video, TEDx Talk, podcast, or YouTube video (minimum 10 minutes) and write a 2-page (double-spaced) critique reflecting on core issues. Provide a reference or link to your selection. Include a very brief summary of the content and apply class principles in analyzing it. Select content involving an issue with psychological and global relevance (e.g., mental health, education, inequality, well-being).

Conduct a critical analysis of the video considering questions such as: What percentage of the content is unsupported by evidence? What are the descriptive and injunctive norms related to the issue? Does the presenter provide clarity for the main arguments? How does the presenter know what they claim to know? How could claims be tested experimentally? Are there good reasons to believe what is argued?

**[Final Presentation: TED Talk Video](materials/assignment_final_ted_talk.md) (150 points)**: Create your own 5-7 minute TED Talk on a topic of your choice. Unlike most TED Talks, yours should make clear that claims are based on existing logical, systematic, or empirical evidence. You may choose to revise the content from your Video/Audio Analysis assignment into an evidence-based version.

The first part of your TED Talk should detail a problem, issue, or call to action. The second part should focus on how experimental psychology and behavior genetics speak to the problem. How are science and evidence part of the solution?

Your proposed study must include at least one true independent variable that is directly manipulated. You will be graded on how well you substantiate your hypotheses with relevant theory or published findings, how well you utilize existing literature to structure your proposed experiment, and how well you explain that science is part of the solution. Include a 1-page outline of your experiment and a Figure or Table illustrating expected findings.

Assignments are due as follows:
- Reaction Essays: Due before class on discussion day
- Video/Audio Analysis: Week 4
- Final TED Talk: Finals week

### Integrity and "AI" Policy

[UIUC Student Code Academic Integrity Policy](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-402)

Make good choices. You are ultimately responsible for the content of what you submit. The landscape of computer assistance for research and knowledge production is ever changing. A good guideline is that if you would be uncomfortable describing your process for producing work for this course (to me, to your parents, or announced on a roadside billboard), you should re-evaluate your approach. If you are in doubt, reach out to discuss options and approaches. I am a reasonable, practical person, and I can tell you from experience that the examples of (obviously) "AI" generated work that I have encountered have been terrible enough that they end up earning failing scores on their merits alone. We will work through some examples of how AI/large language models fail to reason competently in this area (true for most fields, once you get into advanced knowledge production and synthesis, as we do in college courses). If you would like to quickly see for yourself, try talking to any LLM about a topic you are very knowledgable about... it'll say wrong things that sound good, except you know better. This is true for genetics as well (maybe even especially so, considering the amount of misinformation on the internet that these models have to draw from) - you will get a lot of confident nonsense that to an expert (like me) is obviously, hilariously, depressingly wrong.

### Accessing Course Readings

PDFs of Course Readings will be posted on the course Canvas page. 

If you are accessing readings from outside of the course, I've tried to mark articles that are freely available as (open access). For those that aren't, many are old/popular enough that there are freely available PDFs floating around on the internet if you search for the article. If you have access to a University library system, most of these journals will likely be available online through your library. 

When you pay to access a journal article, that money goes to the publisher, not to the authors or their institutions. Especially newer articles you can usually get by emailing the author (first, last, or corresponding) - we love to hear that someone wants to read our work! Services like Sci-Hub ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub)) bypass journal paywalls to provide free access. 

During the first half of the course we will also be reading through Catherine Baker's (2004) Behavioral Genetics: An Introduction to How Genes and Environments Interact Through Development to Shape Differences in Mood, Personality, and Intelligence, a product of a project conducted by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and The Hastings Center, which is available as an [open access book](https://www.aaas.org/resources/behavioral-genetics/publications).
