## <a name="syllabus"></a>Syllabus

The aim of this course is to provide students with a clearer understanding of the contribution that genes make to individual differences in behavior. Students will be in a better position to evaluate evidence for and against genetic and environmental influences. They will also gain an appreciation of the interrelationships of biological and social causes of behavior and will gain a better understanding of influences that might affect themselves and others.

In this course you will:

- Understand how the basic principles of genetics can be used in the study of behavior,
- Evaluate the extent to which human individual differences are influenced by genes,
- Consider the implications of genetic knowledge in psychology.

Prerequisites: Senior standing, psychology major. This seminar focuses on engaging with primary research literature through reading, discussion, and critical evaluation of behavior genetics research.

### Ethics Statement

The history of behavior genetics is inextricably linked with eugenics and racism. 

We will discuss the historical and current ways in which behavior genetics has been used to support white supremacy, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and ableism. 

The use of behavior genetics research and principles to support racism and other forms of discrimination is based on (often willful) misinterpretation of the underlying statistical models on which the science relies. 

There are reasonable questions to be asked about whether it is possible to conduct behavior genetics research without doing harm to marginalized people. 

One goal of this course is to understand the forms of knowledge production that are used within behavior genetics, interrogate the limits of that knowledge, and consider how behavior genetics has been/is/will be used (and misused) to impact the lives of real people.

### A Note on Pedagogy

This half-semester seminar is designed as an advanced undergraduate course focused on developing core competencies for critical evaluation of current and future knowledge in behavior genetics. As genetics - especially as related to complex behaviors and experiences - is a constantly developing field, the course emphasizes skill development in accessing, reading, evaluating, and synthesizing primary research literature. There are no exams; the major grade/product is a term paper on any topic of the students' choosing, along with an accompanying piece of public-oriented science communication. The scaffolded process helps students develop specialized expertise in their chosen area.

Every instructor or textbook author necessarily makes decisions about what content to include, to focus on, to elevate or gloss over, and I am no different. There is no such thing as a neutral presentaion of any topic, much less one that has such profound and personal implications for individuals and society. For this reason, the material is not written as if by a neutral third party - I very intentionally present information from my first-person perspective, as both an expert in the field and as a whole human being. 

This course is designed differently than the typical human behavior genetics course. The focus is less on preparing STEM-focused students to be academic or industry researchers (although many of my students certainly go that way) and more on preparing a diverse range of undergrads and graduate students to be consumers, caregivers, and citizens in a world where genetics is increasingly marketed as a way to make critically important decisions, both personally and as a society.

If you are looking for material that takes a more standard approach to an introduction to human behavior genetics, I recommend Scott Stoltenberg's [Foundations of Behavior Genetics](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/foundations-of-behavior-genetics/D56A9C68E53ED87EAD1E5529A88CC3D0#overview) textbook and/or Matt McGue's [Introduction to Behavioral Genetics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/behavioralgenetics) course on Coursera. 

### Course Structure

This half-semester seminar meets over 8 weeks. Consistent with an expectation that a course takes about 3 times the number of credits in hours per week, as a 3-credit course, plan to spend an average of 9 hours per week working on this course. Points earned for weekly participation activities and course project assignments are scaled such that each point is expected to take about 1 hour of effort, including time to prepare (e.g. read, think) and complete (e.g. write, edit) the task.

**Grades** are based on the total number of points earned by the end of the semester. Points come from weekly activities (up to five points per week for 8 weeks) and a course project (including four assignments leading up to a term paper, totaling up to 40 points). There are potentially 80 points to be earned throughout the semester.

| Points | Letter Grade |
| --- | ----------- |
| 72 + | A |
| 64 - 71.999 | B |
| 56 - 63.999 | C |
| 48 - 55.999 | D |
| < 48 | F |

There are no +s or -s, only letter grades. 

You may notice that the table for converting points into final grades doesn't quite scale at 10% increments (eg. 90% of 80 is 72, but that's exactly what you need for an A). The grading scale is designed to maintain the same standards as the full-semester version while accounting for the compressed timeframe. 

**Activities** are scaled so that 1 activity = about 1 hour of effort = 1 point. You can earn up to five points per week from activities. Every week there will be more than five options for activities available; you are welcome to choose-your-own-adventure in terms of which activities you complete. The list of activities available each week is contained as the 'module' for that week. You are expected to at least skim everything early in each week to (1) decide which activities you're going to do and (2) quickly be able to reference any particular section of readings that come up for discussion in class that week. 

Weekly activities are due by Friday 5 pm that week. Late weekly activities may be submitted by Monday 5 pm for 80% credit.

Each class attended earns 1 activity point. Lectures and discussions will be generally structured around that week's readings. Class attendance points can't be made up or submitted late, but there will be at least five asynchonous activity options each week, so even if you are unable to attend class you can still earn all of your weekly points. 

Outside of class, the most common weekly activity will be annotating/virtually discussing journal articles in Perusall. Perusall applies automatic scoring based on an algorithm that I define; usually, about 4 high-quality comments or replies on an article will earn a point.

Throughout the semester, you will develop a **Course Project** about a topic related to human behavior genetics that is of interest to you, with the goals of identifying, understanding, and synthesizing recent and historic scholarly sources; developing expertise in a specific topic of interest; and communicating knowledge to a general audience. The course project includes four major assignments up to and including the final paper:

- Week 4: [Five Scholarly Source Summaries](week_04/course_project_five_scholarly_source_summaries.md) (10 points)
- Week 6: [Draft Paper](week_06/course_project_draft_paper.md) (10 points)
- Week 7: [Draft Popular Source](week_07/course_project_draft_popular_source.md) (10 points)
- Week 8: [Final Paper and Popular Source](week_08/course_project_final_paper.md) (10 points)

Course Project assignments are due by the Monday after the listed week by 5 pm. The Final Paper is due by 5 pm on the last day of the course. Late Course Project assignments lose 10% of their grade per day late.

### Integrity and "AI" Policy

[UIUC Student Code Academic Integrity Policy](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-402)

Make good choices. You are ultimately responsible for the content of what you submit. The landscape of computer assistance for research and knowledge production is ever changing. A good guideline is that if you would be uncomfortable describing your process for producing work for this course (to me, to your parents, or announced on a roadside billboard), you should re-evaluate your approach. If you are in doubt, reach out to discuss options and approaches. I am a reasonable, practical person, and I can tell you from experience that the examples of (obviously) "AI" generated work that I have encountered have been terrible enough that they end up earning failing scores on their merits alone. We will work through some examples of how AI/large language models fail to reason competently in this area (true for most fields, once you get into advanced knowledge production and synthesis, as we do in college courses). If you would like to quickly see for yourself, try talking to any LLM about a topic you are very knowledgable about... it'll say wrong things that sound good, except you know better. This is true for genetics as well (maybe even especially so, considering the amount of misinformation on the internet that these models have to draw from) - you will get a lot of confident nonsense that to an expert (like me) is obviously, hilariously, depressingly wrong.

### Accessing Course Readings

PDFs of Course Readings will be posted on the course Canvas page. 

If you are accessing readings from outside of the course, I've tried to mark articles that are freely available as (open access). For those that aren't, many are old/popular enough that there are freely available PDFs floating around on the internet if you search for the article. If you have access to a University library system, most of these journals will likely be available online through your library. 

When you pay to access a journal article, that money goes to the publisher, not to the authors or their institutions. Especially newer articles you can usually get by emailing the author (first, last, or corresponding) - we love to hear that someone wants to read our work! Services like Sci-Hub ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub)) bypass journal paywalls to provide free access. 

During the first half of the course we will also be reading through Catherine Baker's (2004) Behavioral Genetics: An Introduction to How Genes and Environments Interact Through Development to Shape Differences in Mood, Personality, and Intelligence, a product of a project conducted by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and The Hastings Center, which is available as an [open access book](https://www.aaas.org/resources/behavioral-genetics/publications).
