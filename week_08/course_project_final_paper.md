title: Course Project, Final Paper and Popular Source

---

It's time to finalize both your scholarly review paper and your popular source science communication piece. 

## Objectives

- Integrate feedback from a variety of sources.
- Produce a brief review paper communicating current knowledge about a specific topic in behavior genetics.
- Create an accessible popular source that communicates key findings to a general audience.

## Time Estimate

10 hours total (5 hours for final paper revision, 5 hours for final popular source)

## Assignment Instructions - Final Paper

Your final paper will be about 2,500 to 3,500 words (10 - 14 pages) plus references. It is evaluated primarily on topic coverage and synthesis, as well as organization, grammar, formatting, and responsiveness to feedback.

Some suggestions for how to tackle the revision process:

1. Review feedback you received on your draft and use it as a checklist of issues to potentially address. Some will be straightforward, others will require some thought, and still others may just be suggestions you choose not to follow.

2. Think about how your popular source changed as it developed. Were there any new pieces of information or new approaches to organizing your material that could be integrated into your paper?

3. Go through tips for self-editing your writing.

4. Go through the document to check for APA-style, including a title page, abstract, full list of references, and use of in-text citations.

### Final Paper Evaluation

5 points possible. See the Final Paper Rubric below for how points will be assigned.

| Criteria | High Quality = 100% | Mid Quality = 50% | Low Quality = 0% | Total Points Possible |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Topic Coverage | Provides broad coverage of a range of behavior genetic approaches to the topic, or in-depth coverage of a specific area/method of genetic research on the topic. Information comes from a variety of primary research reports and includes the student's own synthesis or summary of the current research literature. Concepts are clearly presented and technical terms are defined. | Coverage of the topic is superficial. Some technical terms remain undefined or there are points that are not clearly presented/described. Excessive use of quotations (research findings not restated in the student's own words). | Presented research is not clearly related to course themes. Reliance on one or two existing review papers of the topic, instead of primary research reports. | 3 points |
| Organization, Grammar, Formatting, Response to Feedback | Well-organized and easy to follow with a clear narrative flow. Near perfect grammar and spelling. Near perfect APA style, including paper structure and formatting, title page, abstract, in-text citations, and reference list. Final paper is clearly responsive to reasonable suggestions made during feedback. | Specific topics clearly organized into sections, but little to no transition between topics and/or lack of "big picture" summary of topic, either in introduction or conclusion sections. Several noticeable grammar or spelling errors. Several noticeable errors in APA style. Some improvements made in response to feedback but several major concerns or reasonable suggestions that were made are ignored. | Little to no clear organization; difficult to follow or understand topic being addressed or argument made in several sections. Frequent errors of grammar or spelling that make the paper difficult to read. Little to no evidence of use of APA style; missing a major element such as title, abstract, or citations. Little to no evidence of improvement since the draft version. | 2 points |

## Assignment Instructions - Final Popular Source

Your final popular source should be a polished piece of science communication that makes your research topic accessible to a general audience. This could be in the form of a blog post, magazine article, infographic, video script, or podcast script.

The popular source should:
- Be accessible to readers without specialized knowledge in genetics or behavior genetics
- Accurately represent the science from your scholarly review
- Engage the reader's interest
- Be approximately 800-1200 words (or equivalent for non-text formats)
- Include references or links to sources (can be simplified compared to APA format)

Review feedback you received on your draft popular source and make appropriate revisions. Consider:
- Clarity and accessibility of language
- Engagement and interest level
- Accuracy of scientific content
- Appropriate use of examples or analogies
- Visual elements (if applicable)

### Final Popular Source Evaluation

5 points possible. See the Final Popular Source Rubric below for how points will be assigned.

| Criteria | High Quality = 100% | Mid Quality = 50% | Low Quality = 0% | Total Points Possible |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Accessibility and Engagement | Content is accessible to general audience with no specialized knowledge. Technical terms are explained. Writing is engaging and maintains reader interest. Creative use of examples, analogies, or visuals to convey concepts. | Some technical language remains unexplained. Writing is clear but not particularly engaging. Limited use of examples or analogies. | Heavy use of jargon without explanation. Writing is dry or difficult to follow. No attempt to make content engaging for general audience. | 3 points |
| Scientific Accuracy and Synthesis | Accurately represents findings from scholarly sources. Shows clear connection to student's research. Appropriate caveats about limitations of research. Demonstrates understanding of the topic. | Minor inaccuracies or oversimplifications. Weak connection to student's scholarly sources. Missing important caveats or limitations. | Significant inaccuracies or misrepresentations of research. Little connection to student's scholarly work. Misleading claims about what research shows. | 2 points |

## Submission

Submit both your Final Paper and Final Popular Source by the deadline. Late submissions will lose 10% of their grade per day late.
