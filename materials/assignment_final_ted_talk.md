title: Final Assignment - TED Talk Video Presentation

---

## Overview

Create your own 5-7 minute TED Talk on a topic of your choice. This final assignment is worth 150 points and is due during Finals Week.

## Objective

To contrast, compare, and understand the differences between unsupported claims and evidence-based communication, and to restrict communication to evidence-based information.

## The Assignment

**Create a TED Talk (5-7 minutes) that:**
1. Details a problem, issue, or call to action
2. Explains how experimental psychology and/or behavior genetics speak to this problem
3. Proposes a research study that would address the problem
4. Demonstrates that science and evidence are part of the solution

**Unlike most TED Talks**, it should be **clear that the claims in your talk are based on existing logical, systematic, semantic, or empirical knowledge and/or evidence.**

## Content Requirements

### Part 1: The Problem (approximately 2 minutes)

Detail a problem, issue, or call to action. This should:
- Be clearly articulated and specific
- Have psychological and/or social relevance
- Engage the audience's interest

### Part 2: The Science (approximately 3-5 minutes)

Focus on how experimental psychology and behavior genetics speak to the problem(s) you raised in Part 1:

- How are science and evidence part of the solution to the problem?
- What does existing research tell us about this issue?
- What theoretical framework helps us understand this problem?

**Experimental Proposal:** Include a theoretically-driven set of hypotheses and a brief description of methods and procedures.

**Study Requirements:**
- Must include at least one true, independent variable (directly manipulated)
- Should test your hypotheses experimentally
- The moderation design (e.g., a 2 × 2 design) and the mediation design are highly appropriate and encouraged designs

**Address these questions:**
- What is your research question?
- What are your hypothesis(es)?
- Why would this research be important to the issue(s) raised in your talk?
- What are the potential applications?

## Deliverables

You must submit TWO items:

### 1. Video of Your TED Talk (5-7 minutes)
- You may edit the talk any way you like
- Try to make it look like a TED Talk (consider your setting, presentation style, visual aids if appropriate)
- Minimum 5 minutes, maximum 7 minutes

### 2. 1-Page Experiment Outline

Include:
- **Research question** and **hypothesis(es)**
- **Brief description of methods and procedures:**
  - Participants
  - Independent variable(s)
  - Dependent variable(s)
  - Procedure
- **Purpose:** Why would this research be important? What are its potential applications?
- **Expected findings:** Include a Figure or Table that illustrates your expected findings

## Alternative Approach

One option is to turn the content you selected for the Video/Audio Analysis assignment into a talk that actually uses evidence-based reasoning and communication. That is, create a revised version of what you believe the talk you selected for the Video/Audio Analysis assignment **should have included**.

## Evaluation

Your TED Talk will be graded on the following criteria:

| Criterion | Points | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Problem Articulation** | 20 | Clarity and relevance of the problem, issue, or call to action presented |
| **Evidence-Based Content** | 40 | How well you substantiate your claims with relevant theory or previously published findings |
| **Use of Literature** | 30 | How well you utilize the existing literature to structure your proposed experiment |
| **Experimental Design** | 30 | Quality of research question, hypotheses, and proposed methods |
| **Science as Solution** | 20 | How well you explain that science is part of the solution to the problem you discuss |
| **Presentation Quality** | 10 | Clarity, engagement, and professionalism of delivery; adherence to time limit |

**Total: 150 points**

## Tips for Success

**Content Development:**
- Start with a problem or issue that genuinely interests you
- Research what's already known about this topic in the scientific literature
- Think about what we still need to know - this becomes your research proposal
- Make sure your experimental design actually tests what you claim it will test

**Presentation Style:**
- Watch a few TED Talks to get a sense of the format and style
- Practice your talk multiple times
- Time yourself - staying within 5-7 minutes is important
- Consider using visual aids (slides, props) if they enhance your message
- Be clear about when you're citing existing evidence vs. proposing new research

**Technical:**
- Test your recording setup before the final recording
- Ensure good audio quality
- Consider your background and lighting
- Edit out major mistakes, but don't worry about making it perfect

**The 1-Page Outline:**
- This should be a clear, concise summary of your proposed experiment
- Include all required elements (RQ, hypotheses, methods, purpose, expected findings)
- The figure or table showing expected findings helps illustrate what you predict will happen

## Due Date

Finals Week (check course schedule for specific date)
