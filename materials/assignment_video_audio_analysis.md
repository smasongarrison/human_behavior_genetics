## Media Selection

Select one of the following:
- A TED Talk video
- A TEDx Talk video
- A podcast episode
- A YouTube video

**Requirements:**
- Minimum of 10 minutes of content

## Assignment Format

Write a 2-page (double-spaced) critique of the video or podcast you selected.

**Required elements:**
1. Provide a reference or link to your selection
2. Include a very brief summary of the content (1-2 paragraphs maximum)
3. Apply class principles in analyzing the content (majority of your essay)

## Analysis Questions

Conduct a critical analysis of the video considering the following questions (you don't need to answer all of them, but use them to guide your thinking):

**Evidence and Claims:**
- What percentage of the content do you perceive to be unsupported by evidence? Provide examples (maximum of 3).
- How does the presenter know what he/she claims to know?
- How could arguments, claims, or ideas presented by the presenter be tested experimentally?
- Are there good reasons to believe what is argued/pushed by the presenter? What are they?

**Clarity and Logic:**
- What are you uncertain about regarding this issue?
- Does the presenter provide clarity for the main argument(s) being made? How so?
- How might the content differ from that of an expert's perspective on the issue?

**Social Context:**
- What are the descriptive norms related to the issue? (What do people actually do?)
- What are the injunctive norms related to the issue? (What do people think should be done?)
- What aspects of the issue affect quality of life?

**Impact:**
- What consequences does misinformation or unsupported claims surrounding the issue have?
- When unsupported claims are evident, what appears to be their purpose or function?

**Overall Assessment:**
- If you were to grade the presenter's work, what grade would you give them? Why?

## Objectives

- Apply critical thinking skills to evaluate scientific and psychological claims
- Distinguish between evidence-based assertions and unsupported claims
- Recognize how research findings are (mis)represented in popular media
- Consider the social implications of how psychological and genetic information is communicated

## Evaluation

Your analysis will be evaluated on:

| Criterion | Points | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Summary** | 5 | Brief, accurate summary of the media content |
| **Critical Analysis** | 30 | Depth and quality of critical analysis; application of course principles to evaluate claims |
| **Evidence & Examples** | 10 | Use of specific examples from the media to support analysis |
| **Writing Quality** | 5 | Clear organization, grammar, and adherence to format requirements |

**Total: 50 points**

## Tips for Success

- **Watch/listen to something you haven't seen before.** Come to me for suggestions if needed.
- **Take notes while watching.** Pause to jot down specific claims, examples, or moments that stand out.
- **Focus on analysis, not summary.** Your summary should be brief; the bulk of your essay should be critical analysis.
- **Use specific examples.** Reference specific moments, claims, or arguments from the media when making your points.
- **Connect to course content.** Apply concepts and principles we've discussed in class to your analysis.

## Due Date

Week 4 (check course schedule for specific date)
