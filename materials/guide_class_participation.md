title: Class Discussion and Participation

---

## Overview

Class Discussion and Participation is worth 100 points total (approximately 14 points per week over 7 weeks). This is a seminar course, which means active participation in discussions is essential to the learning experience.

## Expectations

The learning experience in this seminar involves **active sharing of thoughts during class discussions** focused on the required readings. 

**Come to class:**
- Having completed the assigned readings
- Willing and prepared to voice your thoughts and opinions
- Ready to ask questions and engage with others' ideas
- Open to considering multiple perspectives

## Preparing for Discussion

Your Reaction Essays help prepare you for class discussion by encouraging you to think critically about the readings before class.

As you review assigned readings, write your Reaction Essays, and think about upcoming class discussions, consider:

- **What is the main research question of the article?**
- **What is the answer or conclusion that the article provides for this question?**
- **What evidence is used in support of this conclusion?**
- **Is this evidence sound?**
- **What questions do you still have about this paper?**
- **What aspects of the paper remain unclear?**
- **Are there weaknesses in the methodology, statistics, or conclusions?**
- **Are there any other aspects of the article that draw criticism or cause concern?**

## What Counts as Participation?

Quality participation includes:

**Contributing to Discussion:**
- Sharing your thoughts and interpretations of the readings
- Asking questions about concepts you find unclear
- Offering examples or applications of concepts
- Making connections between different readings or course topics

**Active Listening:**
- Responding thoughtfully to others' comments
- Building on others' ideas
- Asking follow-up questions
- Respectfully challenging or questioning ideas (not people)

**Engaging with Complexity:**
- Acknowledging uncertainty and nuance
- Considering multiple perspectives
- Recognizing the limitations of research
- Thinking critically about ethical implications

## Seminar Discussion Norms

To create a productive learning environment:

- **Be present:** Give the discussion your full attention
- **Be prepared:** Complete readings before class
- **Be respectful:** Listen actively, don't interrupt
- **Be thoughtful:** Think before you speak, but don't over-prepare
- **Be inclusive:** Make space for others to contribute
- **Be willing to change your mind:** Consider new perspectives
- **Be honest:** It's okay to say "I don't know" or "I'm confused about..."

## What Makes a Good Discussion Contribution?

**High-Quality Contributions:**
- Reference specific parts of the readings
- Offer analysis or interpretation, not just summary
- Make connections between ideas
- Raise thoughtful questions
- Acknowledge complexity and nuance
- Consider ethical or social implications

**Less Helpful Contributions:**
- Summarizing what we all read
- Speaking without having done the reading
- Dominating the conversation
- Dismissing others' perspectives without consideration
- Making unsupported claims

## Grading

Your participation grade (100 points total) will be based on:

- **Consistent attendance** (40 points): Attending class meetings regularly
- **Quality of contributions** (40 points): The depth and thoughtfulness of your participation
- **Engagement with others** (20 points): How well you listen to and build on others' ideas

You do not need to speak in every class to earn full points. Quality matters more than quantity. A few thoughtful, well-considered contributions each week are better than many superficial comments.

## If Participation is Challenging for You

Some students find it easier to participate in class discussions than others. If you:
- Are uncomfortable speaking in large groups
- Need time to process before responding
- Are worried about saying the "wrong" thing

Consider these strategies:
- Prepare one question or comment before each class
- Use the Reaction Essays to develop your ideas before class
- Speak early in the discussion (it often gets easier after the first comment)
- Talk to the instructor about alternative ways to demonstrate engagement

The goal is for everyone to engage with the material and the learning community, not for everyone to participate in exactly the same way.
