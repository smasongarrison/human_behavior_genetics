title: Assignment - Reaction Essay

---

## Overview

You will write a Reaction Essay for 5 weeks during the semester (10 points each, 50 points total). These essays help you engage critically with the assigned readings and prepare for class discussions.

## Format

Submit a two-page paper in reaction to the readings scheduled for that week. Essays may be:
- Single-spaced (approximately 1,000 words), OR
- Double-spaced (approximately 500 words)
- **Not to exceed two pages** (if you have more to say, reduce the font size and/or margins)

## Purpose

A Reaction Essay is **not** a simple re-wording of the Abstract of an article, or a summarization. It is intended to serve as an intellectual exercise that may take the form of:
- An agreement
- A disagreement
- An elaboration
- A contrast or comparison
- A parallel
- A critical analysis of the work selected

## Getting Started

Examples of sentences to help you begin:

- "I see a contradiction between [Author's] article and the section we read about…"
- "A possible experiment that could be conducted to test the hypothesis described in [Author's] article involves…"
- "The theory described in [Author's] article could be used to improve understanding of…"
- "The theory in [Author's] article helped me to analyze an experience that I once had…"
- "I disagree with the interpretation of the findings described in [Author's] article because…"

## Guidelines for Quality Essays

As you review an assigned reading, write your Reaction Essay, and think about upcoming class discussions, consider:

- What is the main research question of the article?
- What is the answer or conclusion that the article provides for this question?
- What evidence is used in support of this conclusion?
- Is this evidence sound?
- What questions do you still have about this paper?
- What aspects of the paper remain unclear?
- Are there weaknesses in the methodology, statistics, or conclusions?
- Are there any other aspects of the article that draw criticism or cause concern?

## Due Dates

Reaction Essays are due **before class** on the day the readings will be discussed.

You will write Reaction Essays for 5 of the 7 weeks (as indicated in the course schedule):
- Week 1
- Week 2
- Week 3
- Week 4
- Week 5
- Week 6 (skip)
- Week 7 (skip)

Choose which 5 weeks work best for you, or complete all 7 for extra credit consideration.

## Evaluation

Each Reaction Essay is worth 10 points. Essays will be evaluated based on:

- **Depth of engagement** (7 points): Does the essay demonstrate critical thinking about the readings? Does it go beyond summary to analysis, synthesis, or critique?
- **Connection to readings** (2 points): Does the essay clearly reference specific claims, findings, or arguments from the assigned readings?
- **Clarity of writing** (1 point): Is the essay well-organized and clearly written?
