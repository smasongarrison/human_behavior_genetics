title: Course Project, Draft Popular Source

---

Very few people will ever read even the best-written academic paper. Sharing knowledge widely requires presenting it in formats that are quick and accessible. For this assignment, you will create a Popular Source about your Course Project topic, with the goal of communicating information about that topic to the general public in a format that is both informative and engaging. You may choose any popular source format that you would like to use to achieve that goal, as long as you can provide me with a digital version of that popular source. Commonly selected formats include infographics, blog posts, and video presentations (back when the class was small, we did 5-minute talks - feel free to make some slides and record yourself presenting!)

## Objectives

- Draft a popular science communication piece to share what you know about your topic to a broad audience.
- Consider the content and organization that you used in your draft paper in a new format.

## Time Estimate

5 hours

## Assignment Instructions

Create a brief piece (blog post, video presentation, infographic, mocked up wikipedia page, graphic storytelling, or similar) to convey information about your paper topic to the public. Aim for something that would take the viewer no more than 5 minutes to engage with (for example: a 700-1000 word blog post or a 5-minute video of you presenting some slides). 

This draft will help you structure your ideas and allow time for revision. Your [Final Popular Source](../week_08/course_project_final_paper.md) will be submitted as part of your final course project deliverables. 

## Evaluation

10 points possible (for the most part either all-or-nothing, as long as you've made a genuine effort to submit a reasonable attempt at a draft).
